# Environment Architecture

This project trains a model to do prior-art patent search with tools. The main
training path is `prior_art_search/TINKER_grpo_train.py`.

## Data Preparation

Retrieval data is prepared with:

```bash
uv run python prepare.py --limit 500
```

`prepare.py` pulls patent records from `HUPD/hupd` on Hugging Face and builds
the local Chroma retrieval collection:

```text
.chroma_db/patent_collection
```

Training and evaluation scenarios are separate from retrieval preparation. Those
scenarios are synthetic novelty-search tasks generated through the Prime
inference endpoint. Each task rewrites a known patent as a realistic unpublished
invention disclosure plus draft claim, then asks the agent to find prior art:

```bash
uv run python environments/prior_art_search/generate_synthetic_queries.py \
  --model qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b \
  --limit 20
```

By default this reads the same HUPD archive used by `prepare.py` and writes:

```text
environments/prior_art_search/data/synthetic_patent_queries.jsonl
```

The environment expects each scenario row to contain:

- `publication_number`: the gold patent ID
- `query`: the full novelty-search request shown to the model
- `invention_disclosure`: synthetic inventor-style disclosure
- `draft_claim`: synthetic claim-style version of the invention
- `key_features`: claim elements the search should preserve
- `search_instruction`: prior-art search instruction
- `abstract`: source abstract for reference
- `difficulty`: generation difficulty (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`)

The Chroma collection is the retrieval database used by the model's tools. Each
patent is indexed with the important searchable fields:

- title
- abstract
- claims
- CPC / IPCR classifications
- USPC class/subclass
- status / decision
- filing and publication dates

So the model is not searching only over abstracts. Claims and classification
metadata are included in the retrieval text.

## Model Tools

The model can use three actions during an episode.

### `search_patents`

```json
{"tool":"search_patents","arguments":{"query":"...","n_results":10}}
```

This searches the local Chroma patent collection and returns matching patent
titles, publication numbers, and similarity scores.

### `lookup_patent`

```json
{"tool":"lookup_patent","arguments":{"publication_number":"..."}}
```

This retrieves a specific patent from Chroma. The result includes metadata plus
`search_text`, which contains the full indexed patent text used for retrieval.

### `return_final_answer`

```json
{"tool":"return_final_answer","answer":"...","patent_ids":["..."]}
```

This ends the episode. The environment checks whether the returned patent IDs
include the gold `publication_number`.

## Environment

Each environment episode is one prior-art search task.

The model receives:

1. A system prompt explaining the tool format.
2. A user prompt containing the query.

At each turn, the model must output:

```text
Thought: one short sentence
{"tool":"...","arguments":{...}}
```

The environment parses the first JSON object from the model output and runs the
requested tool.

If the model calls `search_patents` or `lookup_patent`, the tool result is added
back into the conversation and the model gets another turn.

If the model calls `return_final_answer`, the episode ends and reward is
computed.

If the model outputs invalid JSON or an unknown tool, the episode ends with no
reward.

## Number of Turns

The default max number of turns is configured in:

```text
prior_art_search/TINKER_grpo_train.config.json
```

Current default:

```json
"max_turns": 6
```

This means the model can make up to six tool-use decisions before the episode is
forced to end.

A typical episode might look like:

```text
Turn 1: search_patents
Turn 2: lookup_patent
Turn 3: search_patents with a refined query
Turn 4: lookup_patent
Turn 5: return_final_answer
```

The model does not have to use all six turns. It can stop earlier by calling
`return_final_answer`.

## Reward Modeling

The reward is simple binary reward.

The environment has a gold patent ID from the scenario row:

```text
publication_number
```

When the model returns final `patent_ids`, the environment canonicalizes IDs by
removing anything after `-`. For example:

```text
US20160220097A1-20160804 -> US20160220097A1
```

Then it checks whether the gold ID is included in the model's returned IDs.

```text
reward = 1.0 if the gold patent is returned
reward = 0.0 otherwise
```

There is currently no partial credit for:

- finding a similar patent
- searching well
- looking up useful patents
- giving a good explanation

Those behaviors only matter if they lead to returning the correct gold patent ID.

## Rollouts

The training loop can run multiple rollouts for the same query. A rollout is just
one sampled attempt by the model in one environment episode.

The relevant config values are:

- `groups_per_batch`: how many different queries are used in one training batch
- `group_size`: how many sampled attempts are run for each query
- `max_turns`: how many turns each attempt gets
- `steps`: how many training batches to run

Example:

```json
"groups_per_batch": 1,
"group_size": 4
```

This means each training step uses one query and samples four independent model
attempts for that same query.

Those attempts can behave differently because generation uses sampling. Some may
find the gold patent and get reward `1.0`; others may fail and get reward `0.0`.
The RL trainer uses that contrast to update the model toward the successful
tool-use behavior.

## Training Loop

The main training command is:

```bash
uv run prior_art_search/TINKER_grpo_train.py
```

The script:

1. Loads the synthetic query scenarios.
2. Opens the Chroma retrieval collection.
3. Builds Tinker environments.
4. Samples model rollouts.
5. Runs tool calls inside each environment.
6. Computes binary reward from the final patent IDs.
7. Sends the trajectories and rewards to the Tinker RL loop.

Training logs are written under:

```text
training_logs/
```

The most useful debug file is:

```text
training_logs/traces/<run_id>/tool_trace.jsonl
```

It records what the model did at each turn: the query, parsed tool call, tool
result preview, reward, and whether the episode ended.
